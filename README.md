TSP Solver is a web application for solving travelling salesman problem.  
The main goal of this project is to compare the following algorithms:

- Nearest Neighbour
- 2-opt
- ant colony optimization
- simulated annealing
- genetic algorithm
- Hill Climbing
- Particle Swarm Optimization
- Simulated Annealing + Genetic Algorithm

## Technologies
- Spring Boot
- Angular
- Cytoscape.js

## Usage

Clone this repository and go to the root project directory:

```shell
